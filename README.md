#Humble Pie Pizza Company
A simple web page that puts together a pizza order for an entirely fictional pizzaria.
Created for an coding assessment at Epicodus.
###Dependencies:
Built on jQuery-1.11.2, and bootstrap.css.
Full suite of tests built on Mocha.js and Chai.js
###Comments

I would like to add an svg drawing of each pizza including toppings to the order box.
Also incorporating some animated gifs would really bring this project up to the next level.
